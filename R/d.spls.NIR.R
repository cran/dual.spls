#' Dual Sparse Partial Least Squares (Dual-SPLS) Near Infrared data
#' @description
#' This dataset contains near infra red spectra of refined petroleum samples, associated with the values of their density.
#' @usage data(d.spls.NIR)
#' @format A \code{data.frame} of 208 observations. The NIR data contains 1557 variables and the density is a one dimensional vector.
#' @details
#' The NIR data is composed of 1557 variables that represent a regular sequence of the absorbance interval.
#'
#' This data is useful when building a Dual-SPLS regression with \code{NIR} data as the predictor and \code{density} as a response.
