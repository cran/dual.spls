\description{
This package provides a series of functions that compute latent sparse components used in a regression model.
These components are based on a generalization of the classical PLS1 algorithm i.e. for a one dimensionnal response.
Denoting \eqn{\Omega(w)=\|w\|_2} the euclidian norm, the PLS1 algorithm amounts to finding the vector \eqn{w} involved in the evaluation of the dual norm
\deqn{\Omega^*(z)=\max_w(z^Tw) \textrm{ s.t. } \Omega(w)=1,} where \eqn{z=X^Ty},
\eqn{X} is the matrix of predictors and \eqn{y} is the response vector.
This problem is reformulated as follows
\deqn{\Omega^*(z)=\min_{w,\mu}(-z^Tw)+\mu(\Omega(w)-1),}
where \eqn{\mu} is the lagragian multiplier. The resulting solution \eqn{w} is colinear to the coefficients vector.

The PLS1 algorithm is then extended by varying the underlying norm \eqn{\Omega(w)} and notably including some
penalization that leads to sparse regression coefficients for variable selection. For more details refer to (ref). The available norms considered are:
\itemize{
\item PLS1: \eqn{\Omega(w)= \|w\|_2},
\item Lasso: \eqn{\Omega(w)=\lambda \|w\|_1 + \|w\|_2} where \eqn{\lambda} is a positive scalar,
\item Group Lasso with 3 possible norms; for \eqn{G} the number of groups and \eqn{\alpha_g}, \eqn{\lambda_g} and \eqn{\gamma_g} all positive scalars,
\itemize{
\item Norm A \emph{(generalized norm)}: \eqn{\Omega_g(w)=\|w_g\|_2+ \lambda_g \|w_g\|_1} where
\eqn{\Omega(w)=\sum_{g} \alpha_g \Omega_g(w)=1 \textrm{ and } \sum_{g=1}^G \alpha_g=1},
\item Norm B \emph{(particular case)}: \eqn{\Omega(w)=\|w\|_2+\sum_{g=1}^G \lambda_g\|w_g\|_1},

\item Norm C \emph{(particular case)}: \eqn{\Omega(w)=\sum_{g=1}^G \alpha_g \|w \|_2+\sum_{g=1}^G \lambda_g \|w_g \|_1}
where
\eqn{\sum_{g=1}^G \alpha_g=\sum_{g=1}^G \gamma_g=1} \cr and \eqn{\Omega(w_g)=\gamma_g}.
}
\item Least Squares: \eqn{\Omega(w)=\lambda \|N_1w\|_1 + \|Xw\|_2} where \eqn{N_1} is a matrix and \eqn{\lambda} is a positive scalar,
\item Ridge: \eqn{\Omega(w)=\lambda_1 \|w\|_1 +\lambda_2 \|Xw\|_2 + \|w\|_2} where \eqn{\lambda_1} and \eqn{\lambda_2} are both positive scalars.
}
This package also suggests \itemize{
\item a calibration and validation method called CalValXy based on a modified version of the Kennard
and Stone Algorithm (ref),
\item a function that simulates data composed of Gaussian mixtures,
\item a function that chooses the number of components according to the cross validation procedure,
\item a series of functions that display results and help in the interpretations.
\item a real data representing 208 near infrared spectra of refined petroleum sapmles with their density (ref).
